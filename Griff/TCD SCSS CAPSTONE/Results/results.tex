\chapter{Results and Discussion}

The data and discussion of results below come in a combination of data gathered using the OONI probe in Ireland and Iraq, as well as published OONI data from the OONI Measurement Aggregation Toolkit (MAT).

\section{Test Results}

\subsection{Website Accessibility Results}

\subsubsection{Collected Data}

This section presents an analysis of website accessibility data collected using the OONI Probe. Tests were conducted locally in Ireland and through a virtual machine (VM) hosted in Iraq. The results reflect the average number of websites blocked per day over a 9-day testing period. The findings are categorized by country, blocking method, and website category to highlight differences in censorship patterns.

\vspace{2em}

\begin{table}[H] 
\centering 
\caption{Proportion of Blocked vs. Unblocked Websites by Country (Daily Average Over 9 Days)} 
\begin{tabular}{lccc} 
\toprule 
\textbf{Country} & \textbf{Unblocked} & \textbf{Blocked} & \textbf{Blocked (\%)} \\
\midrule 
Ireland & 105 & 32 & 23.4\%  \\
Iraq & 108 & 29 & 21.2\% \\
\bottomrule 
\end{tabular} 
\label{tab:blocked_summary} 
\end{table}

Despite expectations of greater censorship in Iraq, the average number of blocked websites per day was relatively similar between the two countries, with Ireland showing a slightly higher blocking percentage. 

Table 4.2 shows the distribution of blocking methods in Ireland and Iraq.

\begin{table}[H] 
\centering 
\caption{Distribution of Detected Blocking Methods by Country} 
\begin{tabular}{lcccc} 
\toprule 
\textbf{Blocking Method} & \shortstack{\textbf{Iraq} \\ \textbf{Frequency}} & \textbf{Iraq \%} & \shortstack{\textbf{Ireland} \\ \textbf{Frequency}} & \textbf{Ireland \%} \\
\midrule 
TCP/IP         & 18 & 60.0\%  & 15 & 55.6\% \\
DNS            & 1  & 3.3\%   & 6  & 22.2\% \\
HTTP           & 3  & 10.0\%  & 1  & 3.7\% \\
Error/Failure  & 8  & 26.7\%  & 5  & 18.5\% \\
\bottomrule 
\end{tabular} 
\label{tab:blocking_methods_comparison} 
\end{table}

TCP/IP blocking emerged as the most common method overall, indicating the use of low-level network interference. Ireland had more cases of DNS-based blocking than Iraq, whereas HTTP and Error/Failure blocks were more evenly distributed.

The table below shows the number of websites blocked in each category in both countries.

\bottomrule 
\end{tabular} 
\label{tab:category_block} 
\end{table}

The most frequently blocked category in Ireland was “Piracy / Streaming / File Sharing” (50\%), followed closely by “Uncategorized” sites (40\%). In Iraq, “Religious” websites experienced the highest rate of censorship (75\%), with additional blocks targeting sites associated with adult content and gambling.

\subsection{Circumvention Test Results}

\subsubsection{Ireland}

Ireland likely does not block Tor on any of its ASNs, as it is largely accessible outside of 2 anomalies.

\textbf{March 18, 2025} - Magnet Networks Limited (AS34245) - Tor Test (1 anomaly out of 78 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250318181530.182975_IE_tor_8b558463294b2881

\textbf{March 31, 2025} - Liberty Global B.V. (AS6830) - Tor Test (1 anomaly out of 191 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250331102020.562562_IE_tor_913ee551111fe0a9

Outside of these two anomalies, there is no evidence that Tor is being blocked in Ireland.

Psiphon on the other hand yielded different results. While Psiphon was largely able to be accessed on most ASNs, there were a few where access is likely blocked.

\caption*{\textit{Note:} "Psiphon Blocking Events" represent detected anomalies during testing of the Psiphon circumvention tool. "Block Rate" indicates the percentage of measurements that showed blocking behavior.}
\label{tab:psiphon_block_ireland}
\end{table}




\subsubsection{Iraq}

Similar to Ireland, Iraq largely does not block access to Tor outside of a few outliers.

\textbf{March 20, 2025} - Super Cell Network for Internet Services LTD (AS209193) - Tor Test (1 anomaly out of 92 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250320220102.873661_IQ_tor_3796e6aaa913670d

\textbf{March 30, 2025} - Hulum Almustakbal Company for Communication Engineering and Services Ltd (AS203214) - Tor Test (2 anomalies out of 160 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250330191838.341920_IQ_tor_f0e7ccd345c39d7f

\textbf{March 30, 2025} - Valin Company for General Trading and Communications LTD (AS205254) - Tor Test (1 anomaly out of 17 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250330111106.914884_IQ_tor_f45745fcedc21407

Outside of these anomalies, there is no significant evidence that Tor is being blocked in Iraq.

There is also little evidence of Psiphon being blocked in Iraq at a significant scale. Aside of a few outliers, Psiphon only seemed to be blocked on one ASN. 

\vspace{2em}

\vspace{1em}

\caption*{\textit{Note:} "Psiphon Blocking Events" refer to instances where the Psiphon circumvention tool exhibited signs of interference. "Block Rate" is calculated as the percentage of blocked measurements over the total measured on each network.}
\label{tab:psiphon_block_iraq}
\end{table}

Based on this data, Psiphon is widely accessible in Iraq outside of AS203214.

\subsection{Instant Messaging Test Results}

The results of the Instant Messaging tests were very similar in Ireland and Iraq. Both tests showed no signs of interference or blocking of Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Whatsapp, or Signal. However, looking outside of the tested ASNs reveals a significant difference between the two countries. The tested data in Ireand is consistent with public OONI data, and shows no blocking of instant messaging platforms. The Iraq data is also consistent with tests run on the same ASN, but in Iraq there are other ASNs that show signs of blocking.

\subsubsection{Ireland}

In the past 30-day period, there were only 2 anomalies found that shows any kind of instant messaging blocking:

\textbf{March 24, 2025} - Packethub S.A. (AS136787) - Facebook Messenger Test (1 anomaly out of 3 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250324111124.418686_IE_facebookmessenger_fbdc8895400acaba

\textbf{March 24, 2025} - HEAnetCLG (AS1213) - Signal Test (1 anomaly out of 37 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250324164458.153631_IE_signal_667f7ad13e55043a

Outside of these anomalies, there was no evidence of instant messaging blocking.

\subsubsection{Iraq}

Iraq had significant evidence of instant messaging platforms being blocked in certain ASNs. The table below shows each ASN, and the percentage of tests where there was an anomaly found.

\caption*{\textit{Note:} Each percentage reflects the proportion of measurements on the respective network where blocking behavior was detected for a specific instant messaging platform. The platforms analyzed include Facebook Messenger, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Signal.}
\label{tab:im_block_iraq}
\end{table}

Instant Messaging platforms are essentially widely available in Iraq, but there are some areas where blocking does occur.

\subsection{Middlebox Test Results}

The results of the Middlebox Test were the same for both countries. Both the HTTP Header Field Manipulation and HTTP Invalid Request Line tests resulted in no Middleboxes being detected in either country. However, while there was no evidence of Middleboxes being found using the providers tested, it is possible that other providers in both countries have Middleboxes present in the network.

Using publicly available OONI data for Ireland and Iraq, it was found that there were cases of Middleboxes being detected in both countries over the past 30 days (March 6, 2025 - April 6, 2025). 

\subsubsection{Ireland}

There is very little evidence of Middleboxes being present in Ireland. Over the past 30-day period, there are only two anomalies present. Both of these anomalies are from the HTTP Invalid Request Line test. 

\textbf{March 25, 2025} - Meteor Mobile Communications Ireland (AS15751) (1 anomaly out of 9 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250325122211.663367_IE_httpinvalidrequestline_c713442d98eebb5c

\textbf{April 1, 2025} - Vodafone Ireland Limited (AS15502) (1 anomaly out of 79 measurements)
%https://explorer.ooni.org/m/20250401215651.365763_IE_httpinvalidrequestline_51f20fe7e9d31698

These results are likely outliers, as there are very little Middlebox tests for Meteor Mobile Communications Ireland in this time span and no other anomalies for Vodafone Ireland Limited.

\subsubsection{Iraq}

There is considerably more evidence of Middleboxes being present in Iraq. Over the past 30 day period, there were 125 anomalies in the HTTP Invalid request line Test and 19 anomalies in the HTTP Header Field Manipulation Test.

The table below lists the ASNs that were suspected to have Middleboxes present using the HTTP Invalid Request Line test. It then shows the number of anomalies, the total measurement count, and what percentage of the total count were anomalies. Note that any ASN that had less than 0.5\% anomalies was ignored.

\section{Comparative Analysis: Ireland v. Iraq}

The combined results of OONI probe testing and public OONI data reveal differences in censorship between Ireland and Iraq. While both countries implement content restrictions and other blocks, there are significant differences in the scale and motivations behind these blocks.

\subsubsection{Website Accessability}

The manually run web connectivity test yielded unexpected results. The proportion of blocked websites in both countries was similar, with Ireland having a slight edge over Iraq. This was unexpected, but it is worthy to note that because these tests were run manually on only one or two networks in each country, these results may only give a partial view of the country's Internet censorship. When looking at the publicly available OONI data, the results become more expected. In the 30-day period, Iraq blocked significantly more websites than Ireland, and at a higher rate. Of the 3703 websites tested in Iraq, 262 of them had anomalies (7\% blocking rate), while of the 1695 websites tested in Ireland, only 43 of them had anomalies (2.5\% blocking rate). Looking at the figures, it is clear that Iraq blocks more content on a more consistent basis than Ireland. 

The blocking rates of websites by category reveal more expected results. Outside of uncategorized websites, Ireland blocked significantly more Piracy / Streaming / File Sharing websites than Iraq, which is in line with Ireland's court-mandated approach to censorship. Conversely, Iraq blocked a wider range of content by category, with a significant blocking rate of religious websites (75\%).

TCP/IP blocking was the top blocking method in both countries, indicating the use of simple censorship mechanisms. Ireland however had a significantly higher rate of DNS blocking, which is likely to do with its approach to targeted website blocking and EU compliance.

\subsubsection{Circumvention Tools}

The accessibility of Tor and Psiphon were largely the same in Ireland and Iraq outside of a few exceptions. Tor was widely accessible in both countries, indicating that both Ireland and Iraq have no significant mechanisms in place to block this tool, and if they do there is no evidence that it is effective. There is evidence that Psiphon is blocked on specific ASNs in both countries, with public OONI data backing this up. Over the same 30-day period, both Ireland and Iraq blocked Psiphon 12.1\% of the time. As a result, there is little evidence that there are systemic efforts to block access to Psiphon, similar to Tor.

\subsubsection{Instant Messaging Platforms}

In Ireland, there is essentially no evidence that instant messaging services are blocked in any meaningful manner. This is inline with Ireland's stance on censorship, and was expected. In Iraq however, there is some evidence that instant messaging services are blocked in some areas, but according to public OONI data they are widely accessible. There are ASNs that had implemented blocks on all four services tested to some capacity, which can indication regional blocking in response to certain events. This is aligned with Iraq's more reactionary censoring practice.

\subsubsection{Presence of Middleboxes}

The use of Middleboxes was almost non-existant, as there were only two anomalies over the 30-day time period, which were likely false-positives. This data indicates that Ireland does not implement TLS or SNI-based filtering in any systematic or widespread manner. By contrast, Iraq showed significant evidence of Middleboxes being present. AS198589 showed significant signs of Middleboxes being present, and there are other ASNs with significant anomalies. This indicates that Iraq may implmelent TLS or SNI-based filtering in some areas of the country, which makes sense as we know that much of Iraq's current censorship efforts are decentralized. 

\subsection{Summary of Comparative Observations}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Comparative Summary of Internet Censorship: Ireland vs. Iraq}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Ireland} & \textbf{Iraq} \\
\midrule
Block Rate (OONI) & 2.5\% & 7\% \\
Blocking Methods & TCP/IP, DNS & TCP/IP, DNS, SNI \\
Tool Blocking & Rare, selective & Targeted, ASN-specific \\
Messaging Blocking & Negligible & Present on some ASNs \\
Middleboxes Detected & Minimal & Present on some ASNs \\
Motivations & Legal, EU compliance & Political, cultural control \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:comparison_summary}
\end{table}

These findings support the initial research, showing that Ireland and Iraq have quite different approaches to censorship. Ireland maintains a limited, legal-centric censorship model, which is transparent and aligned with most other Western nations. Iraq's approach, while less centralized, is more reactive and inconsistent, with it often being tied to internal events. 

\subsection{Future Work}

During this work, it became clear that exporting detailed public OONI data for web connectivity tests would be difficult. This public data would have provided more detailed insights to the differences between Ireland and Iraq. To build upon this work, future research could gather this data using the OONI public API. Using this API would allow for automated collection of web connectivity data in Ireland and Iraq, which would give the writer a broader foundation for comparison. This data would include blocking types, website categories, and ASN information.

Incorporating this public OONI data would facilitate a more holistic analysis of each country, as manual testing is only limited to one geographical location. As seen in this work, OONI tests yield different results in different regions of both countries, so relying solely on manually collected web connectivity data only gives a partial view of a country's current internet censorship.
