\section{Internet Censorship and Privacy}

The primary aim of this work is to identify and compare internet censorship methods between Ireland and Iraq. 

\subsection{Privacy}

User Privacy across the internet is directly tied to censorship efforts from different regimes. In countries where censorship is highly enforced, using anonymity tools to circumvent censorship can protect the right to free expression and access to information. For instance, the \textit{Human Rights Watch} advises people in China to make use of the Tor Browser to avoid abuses by the state \cite{Privacy2017}. 

Based on a meta-analysis of studies related to internet privacy concerns, privacy literacy, and the adoption of privacy-protective measures, it was found that there is no strong correlation between national privacy laws and protective behaviors \cite{baruh2017online}. This suggests that individuals do not rely on legal protections in their country, and more often take privacy into their own hands. It was also found that culture did not impact the use of privacy-protective behaviors in different countries.
