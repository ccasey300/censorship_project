This issue ties into your S & P lectures about bad random number generation and is low priority and realistic.

They use Gosec to test for vulnerabilities in Go code. It has thrown an error regarding the RNG used. They use crypto/rand currently, known to be cryptographically secure. 
crypto/rand is better than math/rand using system-level entropy source.

Solution:
* Improve entropy (entropy pooling)


* Better RNG (??? AES?)


Risks:
* Making the randomness worse. How to ensure? Detecting bad randomness is difficult.


"
We currently use crypto/rand random number generator. However gosec throws a warning indicating that we should be using a stronger one. We should investigate on replacing the current one with something more powerful like math/rand.
