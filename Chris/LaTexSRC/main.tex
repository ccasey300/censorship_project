\chapter{Abstract}

This thesis presents a comparative analysis of internet censorship in Ireland and Israel. Although both are democracies, they differ significantly in political structure and approaches to digital governance. This study investigates how these factors influence the nature, scope, and technical methods of internet censorship in each country. Utilising the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) Probe, both public and curated test suites were used to investigate network interference. The OONI Command Line Interface (CLI) was used to gather ground truth in both Dublin and Tel Aviv.

The tests covered key categories including website accessibility, circumvention tool availability, instant messaging platform functionality, and evidence of middlebox-driven network manipulation. Public OONI data was compared with ground truth in order to derive conclusions about the two countries. EU compliance, the regulation of copyrighted material and the protection of users motivate Ireland's internet censorship. In contrast, Israel has demonstrated its capacity to use internet censorship for political aims.

While both countries show minimal systemic blocking of circumvention tools, isolated casesâ€”such as Psiphon interference were observed. DNS-based blocking was the most common technique in both jurisdictions. This work contributes to the broader understanding of censorship in liberal democracies and highlights the utility of decentralized, open-source measurement tools like OONI Probe in safeguarding global internet freedom.
