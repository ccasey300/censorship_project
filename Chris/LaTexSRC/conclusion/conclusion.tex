\section{Analysis: Ireland vs Israel}
It is clear from the research conducted that Ireland and Israel's internet censorship situations share commonalities. Specifically, both countries are active in censoring pirated media and otherwise illegal content. However this is not the only similarity shared. Both Israel and Ireland were early adopters of internet technologies as illustrated above. Though the two governments participated in this development to varying extents, it resulted in the successful deployment of the internet in both cases. Both countries leverage judicial process to combat pirated media, copyright infringement and otherwise illegal content. Ireland benefits greatly from its membership in the European Union, however this means enforcing GDPR, DSA and more.
