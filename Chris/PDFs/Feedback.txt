Abstract is missing.

Intro:

- "Since its inception, the Internet has served a vast user base that
wishes to communicate with one another and spread information." That
is not true. At it's inception the Internet only had a few users and
many of them do not want to "spread" information, they want to consume
it or communicate with peers. Remember that all sentences should be
true - that 1st opening sentence is not.

- And so is the 2nd sentence: The Internet is designed neither to
filter nor prevent filtering.

- "Across the globe, governments and other entities are censoring
the internet by network manipulation..." citations needed - even if
what you're saying is true (as in this case), evidence is needed,
and that's provided via references or forward pointers to later
sections. (I won't keep pointing these out, but they're everwhere.)

- "The importance of establishing a quantitative approach to
measuring internet censorship cannot be overstated" yes it can, and
you just did overstate that. That's basically trying to sell me the
idea that this is a good thing to do, which is a non-goal. What you
want is to convince me this is good, sound, evidence-based work. You
achieve that by doing it not by saying it needs to be done.

- 1.1.1: "DRI" - expand acronyms on 1st use

- "For the above reasons, the increasingly pervasive censorship done by
governments and corporations around the world is concerning" - to whom?
And who says it's concerning?

- 1.2.1: style thing, the following text has too many uses of "this"
and becomes unclear: "It is also clear that more and more countries are
viewing this as a necessary solution to the unique problems they have.
Whether this is appropriate or not, it is happening, and users should
be aware of this."

- 1.2.1: too opinionated: "Governments have a vested interest in
maintaining control over telecommunications industries and public
internet use. Whether protecting state secrets, preventing cyber
crime piracy or acts of terrorism, insulating from perceived negative
influence, aiding in the creation of propaganda or otherwise; a large
majority of governments choose to exercise inordinate control over the
information available to its public." If you dropped "vested" and
"inordinate" it'd be a lot better, but you don't need to tell me your
opinions in any case.

- 1.2.1: "Enemies of the Internet" FWIW I'd never heard of that. Are
you sure it's still a thing worth mention? The situation has changed
a lot since 2013.

- 1.3: only mention the stretch goal in the report if it's achieved

- 2.2: "Sources deemed potentially unreliable were placed under a higher
level of scrutiny." I don't know what that means - I know what you're
trying to say, but not what you did.

- 2.4.1 the FB case doesn't seem relevant

- 2.5 first section (before 2.5.1) doesn't seem relevant

- 2.5.2 "required platforms such as TikTok and X to remove non-compliant
content" - citation needed

- 2.5.3: "To better appreciate the impact of this war,.." - you used
conflict earlier and that's better - war implies the sides are nation
states which is a) disputed and b) a thing that's changed over the
duration of the conflict. It's especially important to be careful
with language in cases like this - not to self-censor but to remain
factual and objective.

- 2.5.3: the presentation of the Israeli background begs the question
as to why Irish pre-Internet censorship (which was pervasive) is not
described. Might be too late to fix that now.

- 2.5.4: "fixation" isn't appropriate

- 3.1.1: you've not introduced OONI yet

- p19: "snuff out content" isn't right - the content remains, but
is inaccessible

- 3.2.2: "previously trusted projects like TOR" - previously according
to whom?

- 3.3.1: are you sure IP blocking was originally an anti-spam thing?
I'd have to check, but am not sure.

- section 4: side-channels aren't relevant for censors

- 6.6.1: incomplete text

- 6.6.6: "MORE HERE???"

- Refs after [87] are malformed
